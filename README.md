## Description
This is a fork of [pancakeswap-frontend](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-frontend).
The idea for it is to be ran on the ethereum network. Since pancakeswap was originally a uniswap fork, I believe it should be doable.
I will first try to make it work on one of the eth test networks, and if it works I might deploy it on the [cheapeth network](https://cheapethereum.org/) (which is another ethereum fork).

## To update this repo with the changes from the original pancakeswap-frontend repo:
`git remote update`
